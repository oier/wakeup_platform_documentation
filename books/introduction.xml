    <title>Current Internet solutions issues</title>
    <para>
      Internet PUSH solutions are based on a public accesible server which
      handles all the notification delivery.
    </para>
    <para>
      These solutions were designed without considering the mobile networks
      way of working and forces the handset to maintain an open socket with
      the server in order to avoid misnotifications.
    </para>
    <para>
      This way of working increases the signalling and the handsets battery
      consume.
